For Loops + Arrays Project Brief
Scenario
You have been provided with a text file called urls.txt which contains a list of
website URLs. You can find this file in the resources section for this project.
You have been asked to obtain the header information received when trying to
access the homepage for all these sites, and store these headers in individual text
files.
Your Task
Step 1: Using the readarray command, create an array of urls from the provided
urls.txt file
Step 2: Using a for loop iterate over this array utilising the curl command with the
--head option to get the headers for each URL.
Step 3: Redirect the output from each curl command to a new text file for each url.
The name of the text files should be based on the url.
E.g.
www. facebook .com -> facebook .txt
www. google .com > google .txt
www. thingy .net > thing .txt
Hint : Check out the cut command as a way to slice out the appropriate part of the
url to create the filenames.
Extra Guidance
● For this project, you will need to do some independent research using the man
command to learn how the cut and curl commands work. Have fun!
● When using the cut command, check out the -d and -f options.
● You will need to pipe to the cut command from the echo command.
