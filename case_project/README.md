 Step 1: Firstly you need to create a select statement in your script that will present to
 the user a list of the below cities to choose from.
 Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, Moscow, Dubai, Manchester, New York, Paris
 Bangalore, Johannesburg, Istanbul, Milan, Abu Dhabi, Pune, Nairobi, Berlin, Karachi
 Step 2: Secondly you need to set up a case statement that will match each of these
 cities as cases to their respective countries and echo out the country name to the
 user of the script.
 Note : You need to place your case statement inside of the select statement.
 Note : Some of the cities are in the same country. You can use a | to separate these
 within the same case rather than creating separate cases for each.
 For example: A|B) commands ;;
